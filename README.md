This is a **Django**-based backend implementation of a task management system. To get started, you need to install **Django** and **Django REST framework**. Here are the steps:

1. Install **Django** using the following command:
```python
pip install django
```

2. Install **Django REST framework** using the following command:
```python
pip install djangorestframework
```

3. Install **django-cors-headers** using the following command:
```python
pip install django-cors-headers
```

4. Run the server using the following command:
```python
python3 manage.py runserver
```

This will start the server and you can access the backend implementation of your task management system.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
